\chapter{Conclusion}
In summary, we have built a balanced dataset of fake and authentic news articles named Filipino Fake News 2024 and augmented in to Filipino Fake News in our model training. We compared the performance of four models: LR, MNB, RF, and SVC in classifying fake news in the three datasets: Filipino Fake News 2024, Filipino Fake News, and the combination of thr two. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted before final training to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the models. We determined that Logistic Regression is the most suitable model for deployment since it has the highest accuracy wihtout requiring hyperparameter tuning.
